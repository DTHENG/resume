Rixty, Inc.
2011
As Lead Developer, I handled things like api integration's, product localization, and internal CRM tools. I played a key role in the design and development of new products and features, including integrations with Coinstar, Skrill and Microsoft. 
In 2012 Rixty was purchased by MOL, a Malaysian online payments company, this allowed for rapid international expansion in latin america and south east asia. Building on an open-source java stack running in EC2, I worked to improve the efficiency and performance with new tools like elastic search as well as other enhancements to the platform.
