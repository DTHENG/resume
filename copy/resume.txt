I am looking for a company with passion for their product and

Rixty, Inc.

As Lead Developer, I handled things like api integration's,
product localization, and internal CRM tools. I played a key role
in the design and development of new products and features,
including integrations with companies like Coinstar, Skrill and Microsoft.
In 2012 Rixty was purchased by MOL, a Malaysian online
payments company, this allowed for rapid international expansion
in latin america and south east asia. Building on an open-source
java stack running in EC2, I worked to improve the efficiency and
performance with new tools like elastic search as well as other
enhancements to the platform.
