Your Company
2017 - Present
Iâ€™m looking for a company in the financial technology/payments sector with passion
for their product and an ambitious vision for the future.

Wyre, Inc.
2016 - 2017
Wyre is a next generation international money transfer company, supporting real-time
payouts and remittances at a fraction of the cost of other methods. As a senior
software engineer I worked to develop the user facing dashboard as well as
administrative tools for the compliance and accounting teams.

SnapCard, Inc.
2014 - 2016
SnapCard is a bitcoin payments company, focusing on providing tools for easy
management and transfers at the best rate. As a senior software engineer I worked
to add new currencies through integrations with third party exchanges. Being part
of a growing company I also wore many hats, from training new engineers to building
mobile and web applications.

Rixty, Inc.
2011 - 2014
Rixty is an alternative payment system focusing on customers without credit cards.
As a lead developer I managed api integrations (Microsoft, Coinstar, Skrill),
localized our platform for new countries like Brazil and build tools for the
customer support team.
